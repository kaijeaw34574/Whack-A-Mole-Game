# Whack-A-Mole Game

This project is inspired by the arcade game Whack-A-Mole. A mole will come out of the hole, and the player will use a hammer to smash the mole to collect points within the specified time. Which I have adapted this arcade game to be able to play on an online website.

### How to play
  1. The player has 20 seconds to play.
  2. A mole will emerge from the bush.
  3. The player must click on the mole, and the word "Whack" will appear to count as 1 point.
  4. The Player plays until the end of 20 seconds and view the score.
  5. Press refresh to play again.
